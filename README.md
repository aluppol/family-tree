# Family Tree

An app that connects the present and the past.
--

How many can you say about the grandmother of your grandmother? Probably not much. As do I. Probably your grandchildren will be able to say the same about your grandmother. The time and relationships between generations flow only one way - from past to present. And when you want to find out about your ancestors you can find out so little with so huge effort. It's what happened to me. I asked myself - what was important at the end to my grandfather at the end of his life? What thoughts did he live with? Where idea that was put in your mind from your childhood originate?

I don't know how to capture all deepness of the human mind in the database, and how to draw lines through generations of the family. But this is the purpose of this app - this is shot to achieve this goal.
